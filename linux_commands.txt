Changing file or directory permissions

command:

				chmod 777 file_name.txt

--> chmod is the name of the command to modify the permissions

--> 777 is a octal number representation of the permissions (Explaination below)

--> file_name.txt is the name of the file for which the permission is to be changed
		Note: It can be a file name or a directory name.

Permission Type Explaination:
	
	r - Read Allowed
	w - Write Allowed
	x - Execute Allowed

	There are three parts for permissions on whom it should be activated. They are Owner, members of a group, others.
		-rwx(owner) rwx(group member) rwx (others)

	1. the first part is owner
	2. second part is group members
	3. third part is others.

	If u execute the following command

		$ ls -al

	you will get as below,

	-rwx rwx rwx    then other attributes will be displayed.


	the first hyphen indicates whether it is file or a directory

	Eg: 
	 if its a file then 
	 										-rwx rwx rwx 
	 if its a direcory then 
	 										drwx rwx rwx 

	So Octal Explaination:

	7 (octal) - 111 (binary)
	6 (octal) - 110 (binary)

	the three bits in binary indicate the Read , Write and execute.

	1. if it is 111 den read write and execute is allowed. the octal equivalent is 7

	2. if it is 101 den read and execute is allowed and write is denied. the octal equivalent is 5

	so 777 means

		for owner provide read,write and execute

		for group members provide read,write and execute

		for others provide read,write and execute

	so 755 means

		for owner provide read,write and execute

		for group members provide read and execute only
		
		for group members provide read and execute only
